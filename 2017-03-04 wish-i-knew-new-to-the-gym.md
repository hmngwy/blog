# A few things I wish I knew when I started working out

### PPL(a)

Push, Pull, Legs (abs), is a program framework that allows you to hit all the major muscle groups twice in a week. It separates most concentric from eccentric exercises, allowing you to thoroughly work muscles that do similar functions i.e. Push or Pull in one work out. Core work is bundled with legs.

If you are completely new to working out, this will also give you the drive to pursue fitness further as you will see progress weekly. In fact you are supposed to force yourself to progress until you can't, every week you increase the weights by a small amount.

If you stop progressing, i.e. can't increase the weights, you are then an intermediate builder. At which point you can pursue other programs like Stronglifts, or it can also justify getting a professional trainer since you've already built some foundation for the trainer to work with. Here's a good lengthy article about [PPL](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/37ylk5/a_linear_progression_based_ppl_program_for/).

### Concentric vs Eccentric movements

Most repetitions of exercises are pairs of Concentric then Eccentric movement. Concentric movements are supposed to be explosive, then on the eccentric movement you are supposed to resist the weight from taking control. Maintaining control of the weight is key to more effective sets, and reduces the risk of injury.

### Isometric Exercises

These are exercises where no joint or muscle movement occurs, but the target muscle is engaged to sustain a form or posture. There is a reason gymnasts are ripped, most of the moves they hold are considered isometric. This is an exercise that shouldn't be taken lightly. Oh you think you can hold a plank for a minute? Try a [Planche Lean](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=liXL9oE3KzE).

### Repititions and Weights

This is the basic building block of an exercise, and it apparently has more to it than a single movement that you repeat. If a program says do 12 barbell curls, you need to select a weight such that you can barely do the 13th. If 6 reps, you should not be able to do 7. And when I say "able", that doesn't mean "want", it means you must have exerted all effort lifting an amount of weight such that that a 7th rep is impossible.

This is called Repitition Max, and is what most mean when they say "do 12 reps of something", since the amount that can be lifted varies from one person to the other, it's up to the person to find out how much weight is needed to exhaust the target muscle of power. 

### Sets

If you are looking forward to the next set, then you are doing it wrong, you must increase either the weight, the number of reps, or the time under tension. Don't save energy for the next set, the next set is future you's problem, for now make sure you exert all energy and effort in your current set.

### Time Under Tension

Pumping 12 reps of 18kg dumbbell presses in all of 15 seconds can be easy, and this is why exercises shouldn't all be rep-based. Remember Concentric and Eccentric movements? The concentric motion of a rep should almost always be done in or under 1 second, and the eccentric should be done in 3-5 seconds. Not only does this make the exercise more difficult, this encourages focus on form and quality over quantity. There is an advantage of going fast, if the training intends for you to have explosive strength. But if you are building mass, you will want to focus on ripping muscles.

##### Ripping Muscles, literally

I actually already know this, but it's worth writing down. When you work out, you create microscopic tears in your muscle tissue, the scarring and repair that takes place afterwards when you rest is the body building part of getting "ripped" as they say. When you increase the muscle's time under tension, you tend to rip more muscle tissue, hence more to repair, hence more mass built. 

### Abs

Abs is a different kind of muscle such that it's hard to effectively "load" it with weights such that you can train it. I'm not saying there's none, but there's usually some other muscle that's helping carrying the load even with the best mind-muscle connection. 

One way of making sure you tear enough muscle tissue in your core to encourage gains, is to have massive time under tension. Do this by reducing rests, and increasing time in the eccentric movements. Do as much core work as you can, take a break a day before and after Legs and Abs day. 

### Stretches and Warmups

Finally, stretches. When I started working out I didn't bother stretching, nor warming up. I have a very sedentary work life, and so during the exercises I can hear joints crack and stuff. If you are to start pushing your limits with weights you need to stretch to avoid injury. I had a surgery (not workout related) that prevented me from going to the gym for two months, in just three weeks my disabled forearm has completely atrophied, to the point that it was smaller than before I began working out. No, you won't want to stop even for a week when you start working out given how hard it is to progress.

Learn dynamic stretches and do them habitually, even just at home. Now I can't go into an exercise without stretching, it just feels wrong to put sustained stress on your muscles and joints without preparing them. And warm up with an empty bar or light weight before each exercise, it's the perfect time to practice form without weight getting in the way.
